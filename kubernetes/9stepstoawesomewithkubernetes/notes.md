## Intro

- ephemeral storage by default
- shared resources for containers in a pod
  - life-cycle
  - network
  - storage
- Labels
  - important way to manage containers
- make docker command use the docker daemon with k8s
  - `eval $(minikube docker-env)`
  - After this the `docker ..` commands work with k8s docker containers

## Health checks

- `readinessProbe` for health check of a service
  - for kubernetes to know which endpoint to probe to know that the service is up and ready
- `livenessProbe` to know if service is up
