## Notes

3 Goals of FP:
* Immutability
  * Create new data instead of modifying existing data
  * isolate and minimize state changes in the program to few selected points
* Separation of Data and Functions
  * From objects holding functions that mutate its state
    * to functions that take objects and return new objects
  * Don't have to worry about making object members private etc 
    * because mutation is not allowed
